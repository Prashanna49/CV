				<p>Technology evolves, as as it evolves there more we find more convenient ways to get many things done in a day without too much hassle and this is one of the great benefits of having new technology.

To fully answer your question i shall state an answer with both pros and cons that are backed by evidence of existing facts of how new technology affects our life both positively and negatively.

New Technology Improves quality of life for human beings and as a side effect it makes it complex and have a negative effects on the environment.<br><br><!--for breaking the line-->

PROS:

Without technology life would be very difficult and behind. Technology has brought many great things such as the ability to have light during night by using what we call Electricity. Let us use electricity as an example, Electricity alone has taken life on earth for human beings to another dimension. Imagine how bad your day can be and how your life gets stuck if there is no electricity just for four hours. Electricity is the most versatile energy source on the planet, even though we’ve only depended on it for about 100 years now. Its been only hundred years and look how improved life is as compared to 5 centuries ago. So imagine if we had been depended on it from the very start, Life would have been very very much better... People like Newton, Galelio, Maxwell, Gauss, Kepler and others would have developed far more better tools that make life better for all human beings. Imagine a 1000 years with electricity? Life would really be in a different dimension… I wish i could live to witness that.

Technologies such as computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones make it easy for human beings of today to exchange information, make faster decisions, interact socially, get entertainment, process financial transactions efficiently, buy online, manage homes and other existing technologies. This has made it much more efficient to travel because cheap air tickets can be purchased at a press of a button, an Uber cab can come collect you at your own time no more waiting. There is a cheap way of connecting with friends and family through social media and now you don’t have to remember people’s birthday because social media can always remind you.

Technology unlocks life that was unimaginable. Life that only existed in people’s dreams. As Einstein once put it imagination alone is too powerful. Technology is the reflection of people’s imagination on solving existing problems. These problems pushes human beings to transform their imagined ideas to solving these problems into technological innovations which as a result improve life.</p><!--closing paragraph tag-->
